## Course Overview

The "Machine Learning with Big Data" course provided an in-depth understanding of the core principles of machine learning and how it can be applied to analyze vast amounts of data efficiently. Throughout the course, we explored various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation methodologies.

## Machine Learning Concepts

In this section, you'll find Jupiter notebooks that cover essential machine learning concepts. These notebooks were created as part of the course assignments and demonstrate my grasp of topics such as:

- Regression and Classification
- Clustering
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

## Apache Spark Projects

In this section, I've uploaded Apache Spark projects that showcase my ability to work with big data. Leveraging the power of distributed computing, I applied machine learning algorithms to large-scale datasets and gained valuable insights. Some of the projects include:

- Sentiment Analysis on a Massive Text Corpus
- Predictive Customer Segmentation
- Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

## Jupyter Notebooks

This section contains Jupiter notebooks that accompany the Apache Spark projects and demonstrate the data exploration and analysis process. I've included detailed explanations and visualizations to make the notebooks informative and accessible.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the content of this repository to understand the concepts and methodologies covered in the "Machine Learning with Big Data" course. You can clone the repository to your local machine and run the Jupyter notebooks to interact with the code and visualize the results.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/machine-learning-with-big-data.git
cd machine-learning-with-big-data
# Set up your environment as per the requirements and run Jupyter notebooks
```

## Getting Started

If you're new to machine learning or Apache Spark, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics before diving into the notebooks. Here are some helpful resources:
